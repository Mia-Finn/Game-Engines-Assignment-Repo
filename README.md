# Description of the project
My metaverse idea is an interactive campfire scene where the player has the opportunity to explore the scene in Unity 3D while interacting with various aspects of the worlds envionment. There are many ways to experience this world, the player can listen to some music while playing around at the campfire or simply watching it burn, or they can opt to simply take in the scene without the music and only the sounds of the fire and the surrounding nature.

This project was made in the Unity Game Engine, it currently only plays on PC in as a 3D Unity scene, not yet working in VR. There is a low-poly/cartoon like art style to the scene.

# Instructions for use
The player can use the mouse to look around the world and the W, A, S, D keys to move in the game world. The player can interact with most objects in the campfire scene. They can change the look of the game world by changing the time of day the scene is set and by...

# What I am most proud of in the assignment


# What I learned


# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
An interactive campfire experience with sounds, music and particle effects. I aim to make it so that you can change the colours of the fire and maybe even the effects too, as well as interact with the other objects in the environment, like roasting marshmallows and choosing some campfire songs to listen to!
